It was witty, fun and really developed the characters! Bring on season 3!', ""Diary of a Future President is back with its second season on Disney+. This season follows three storylines featuring the Cañero-Reed family. The first plot is that Elena is running for school rep but has many challenges along the way.  The second plot follows Bobby as he learns how to express his sexuality and feel more comfortable with it. The third and final plot follows Gabi and Sam as they learn more about each other as their relationship grows. The plot that was the strongest out of the three was Bobby's arc. Bobby's character arc felt cohesive throughout the whole season without any large bumps in the road. Bobby as a whole felt upgraded as he made new friends and still kept his older ones. Yes, there were a couple of episodes that felt a little cliche, but it worked for Bobby's storyline. I do wish that we got a little bit more time between him and Liam in the second half of the season. It was such an integral part of Bobby's character in the first season, and I think it got a tiny bit lost near the end of the season. Although, Bobby getting together with CJ was nice to see. The second best plot out of the three is Elena's arc and her desire to earn the role of student president. Elena was a strong character throughout the season, yet I still think she was slightly flawed. Elena got herself into a new problem every episode which got a little repetitive after a few episodes since some of them had similar tones. Yes, it all leads to Elena realizing that she needs to focus on others and not just herself if she wants to be student president. However, I don't think the payoff was executed well and felt a bit rushed. Although what I did appreciate was that there was very little drama surrounding Elena and her friends. The first season had too much of that and took away from the show at certain moments. If this show gets a season three, I believe it should focus more on making Elena's actions throughout each episode feel more cohesive and spread out to allow a bigger payoff at the end of the season. Lastly, I found Sam and Gabi's plot to be the weakest of the three. However, I did really like a lot of the storylines they had in the first few episodes. Although, I wish that the writers kept it going throughout the whole season as it focused more on Gabi near the end. There was no problem with it focusing more on Gabi, but it did feel like Sam wasn't doing anything in the last 2-3 episodes. I believe that if Sam connected to the kids a bit more in other episodes, it would have helped his character out a lot. Even with the minor complaints I have about the writing this season, the show does continue to be an enjoyable watch. It is a definite step-up from the first season, which was very kid-centric. This season felt more mature with many significant storylines that any parent, teen, or adult could relate to. Those aspects of the show are brought together with an outstanding cast. Tess Romero and Selenis Leyva were both so superb this season.

The perfect example of this is the second half of the Season where an army is built up over the span of a ton of episodes only to be discarded for the finale and final battle almost completely. Well this season also introduced an incredible villain along King Andreas that particular villain which I found particularly interesting and compelling never really got a chance this time besides the end of the show when it was already a little bit too. The first half was fine but had a big emotional Whiplash from the dramatic ending of True Colors to Slice of Life episodes on Earth without breaking up the traumatic events of the finale of the last season. A couple of plot points also just come out of nowhere with no previous setup and satisfying payoff. Overall I feel like this season wasted too much time for the story was trying to tell. I'll remember amphibia fondly as a pleasant show not a perfect one but definitely one I recommend watching."", 'The finale was epic.', ""The first half of the season is pretty fun, but nowhere near as good as 2 episodes that take place in Amphibia.  The second half before the finale is decent, and only one really stands out. But, it's all worth it for an amazing 3-part finale, which is really phenomenal."", 'All ages admitted!!!!!!!! The greatest final 18 episodes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!', 'While it still has a considerable amount of frustrating fillers, the final season of Amphibia at least builds everything up to an emotionally and visually satisfying finale.', 'it was great, i swear, i never got so attached to a show this much.', 'The first time I watched Amphibia was with my son,  after that I was hooked! Love it!', 'Good season. All episodes were consistently fun and enjoyable to watch while managing to hit home the more dramatic moments. Thematic and character writing are really strong which more than makes up for some issues regarding tone and pacing. Does the season have problems? Yes. But personally, it never detracts from the overall experience of the show. It manages to be a solid finely crafted vibe through and through. For that, I believe this last stretch stuck the landing to cement this show among the peak. 5/5', 'at some point it was boring but now the last season of amphibia will possibly become one of the best seasons for an animated series', ""It so far is okay. I've definitely seen better for sure. Honestly this show is just very bland and boring."", 'The first half changed up the formula of the show a lot, however some of the earth episodes are pretty good, but now the second half appears to be amazing by going back to the old formula while still adding a new spin on it. Plus the story is becoming very important with questions being answered that have been waiting for years to be answered.', 'this season is great!', 'I can only review the first half of the season at this point, but my problems with this stretch of the series is threefold: \n\n1)  The Plantars are now in LA for what amounts to at least 18 episodes.  As it turns out, when you remove a fantasy story from its own setting, it ceases to feel like the same show.  I watched Amphibia because I love the world, and I love how that world was built and animated.  They took what I love about the show most and removed it.  I could tell they wanted to try something new and different, but it was a creative risk that failed, big time.  \n\n2)  The obvious: the placement of these episodes makes them frustrating filler.  I spent the whole time internally yelling, ""BUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN AMPHIBIA?!?!""  I got two episodes detailing Amphibia, and that was it.  It was torture.  \n\n3)  These LA episodes rely on Clark Kent logic.  No one can tell they\'re talking to giant technicolor frogs because of hats, wigs, glasses and a fake nose made of clay.  A face mask does not change the fact that the rest of Sprig is HOT PINK.  And when their disguises do come off, which is often, most people are fairly whatevs about it.  It\'s pushing suspension of disbelief even by kid\'s cartoon standards.   \n\nI find myself increasingly wishing that at the end of season 2, due to the music box malfunctioning or some other accident, the Plantars and Anne were blasted to another continent in the Amphibia world.  Andreas thinks they\'re dead or elsewhere and they have to fight their way back to Amphibia.  It would have been a much better way to include that episodic hijinks and adventure structure they\'re going for, while keeping the tone of the show more intact.  \n\nMy advice?  Binge all of Season 3 when it\'s fully out and race through the LA episodes, if you watch them at all.']",,,,1.0,0.0,0.0

The story behind the episode was genius and I give the writers massive props for having the balls to put that ""Ancient Sins"" scene in!\nEpisode 11 served as the culmination of everything that happened in the series so far and not a single second was a disappointment! The reveal in the end had my jaw on the floor.\nEpisode 12 was, in my opinion, the most fascinating and beautiful episode from a storytelling perspective. It served it\'s purpose and was my favourite until the last episode.\nEpisode 13 established the characters and was a massive load of pure fun.\nEpisode 15 had 2 branching stories that both served a purpose, with one being Mable\'s adventure and one being Dipper\'s revelation. Mable\'s adventure was cute and fun, while Dipper\'s did it\'s job MARVELOUSLY.\nEpisode 17 was definitely the most interesting of them. The part with Dipper and Ford was a satisfactory action fested beauty while Mable\'s stuff set up the end of the episode in the best way possible. And the end... Wow was it good! The best way possible to set up the finale!\nWeirdmageddon... What can I say? Perhaps the best ending to a show I\'ve seen since Death Note. An emotion trip filled with fun, amazement and satisfaction. Shout-out to Bill\'s performance of We\'ll Meet Again because you all know you loved it.

The series still has compelling  episodes like the first and the episodes still keep you on the edge of your seat. The best episode was the movie like special Weirdmaggedon. This episode wasn't good because it was a special, it was good because it was extremely entertaining and you was always worried about what Bill would do next, so it was jaw dropping.

The sister is Lisa if she had suffered a brain injury and had suddenly become infatuated with pigs and glitter or Bart as a girl but much less likable and also probably suffering from a brain injury. The old man with the stupid nickname (I refuse to say it's too stupid) is basically the old man from UP mixed with the personality of homer Simpson and the charm and wit of a rock. \n\nThen a tortilla chip tries to take over the world but is fooled by said idiot who looks the old man from up with the wit of a rock and his slightly more intelligent twin brother. You also have an even uglier and stupider version of Chris from the equally overrated plot-less humorless and idiotic family guy. Gravity falls has none of charm humor or creativity of the classic Simpsons some of convoluted plot and bad acting from twin peaks and murder she wrote an idiotic villain who is easily fooled and defeated and a cliche boring ending."", ""Oh, the thrills, the laughs, the goosebumpy feeling that this show gives me (it means that I'm emotional)...

Again they manage to weave in an overarching plot, this time involving aliens, beneath the individual shenanigans.  Although, it isn't quite as strong as the previous season's. Weird Al Yankovich does a great job as Milo Murphy. Although he uses his basic voice, he's surprisingly good at fitting a persona, and I would forget it's him. Animation remains colorful.\n\nThe biggest issue with this season is that it adds Dr. Doofenshmirtz from Phineas and Ferb. Now don't get me wrong, I loved him in his original show and consider him one of the top funny villains of all time. But here, he draws too much focus. A lot less time is spent at Milo's school with his classmates and the absence was felt. Doofenshmirtz just doesn't fit in. Even his character design differs. He had a nice send-off at the end of Phineas and Ferb and his story should have ended with that. However, his creators are just too fond of him. They did not one but two backdoor pilots for the guy during that show. They need to kill their darling and focus on their new content. \n\nOverall, I was still entertained with this.

Followed the show since the first season and watched it as it came out. One of the best cartoons of the 2010s, imo', 'Star Vs As Forças do Mal no geral é uma série legal e divertida, com personagens muito carismáticos, talvez um dos melhores desenhos da Disney XD. Infelizmente, a série teve um final forçado e muito fraco. A 4° temporada poderia tranquilamente terminar a série, com Mewni sendo governada por uma adoradora de monstros, e muitos dos episódios tratam exatamente dessa adaptação da Eclipsa com ajuda de Star e Marco. Gosto dessa temporada até certo ponto, primeiramente, porque Star teve que terminar seu namoro com Tom? Talvez pra fazer fan service para os fãs malucos por ""Starco"", um casal que eu não apoiava inclusive. Segundo, a Lua como a grande vilã é a coisa mais ridícula que eu já vi, isso com certeza foi uma decisão desesperada e muito precipitada de que fez essa série. Terceiro, pra que destruir a mágica? Essa era a graça da série. Se tivesse uma 5° temporada, não sei como se sustentaria. Concluíndo, a série acaba com um final forçado, um casal forçado e uma vilã forçada, enfim, nada me agradou nesse final, fechou com uma verdadeira ""chave de bosta"" e anulou todas as coisas boas das outras 3 temporadas.', 'The final season manages to be a heavy improvement compared to the last two, but feels overwhelmed with what it\'s given. I loved the animation and I really enjoyed a lot more episodes this time, but the story sadly suffers greatly. Too much time is devoted to ""shipping"" and add layers to it that weren\'t really needed. The overall theme of prejudiced now feels more forced than ever and even the humor doesn\'t help. There was one joke that had me horrified and disgusted so much that I completely blanked out on the rest of the episode ( i.e. Ferguson confuses Mariposa for Marco & Star\'s ""baby"")!! It\'s definitely a mixed bag and it\'s finale is greatly underwhelming, probably the worst i have ever seen from a TV series. If you have thoughts on binging this series, I would highly recommend not checking it out, and definitely, if possible, avoid having your child watch it. The jokes and themes will impact them in very negative ways, take that from me personally. 2.5/5', ""Well the last season may not be strong as the last three seasons, but it does has some moments like the fight action scenes and some good moments, and even with some new twists like the monster globgor was such a sweet guy after eclipsa becomes his love and a husband, and mina turns out to be a bad guy cause her mind was solarian magic was the result when it goes to far, not to mention that this has nothing to do with the fandom shipping the show itself, the show itself doesn't get ideas from fans themselves, the reason is that the characters are trying to hide their feelings each other in fear that it would interfere with friendship, and they date other people so they can put it behind them, but it didn't last long, so it kinda like can you feel the love tonight song like love is actually there and the couple doesn't even know if they're ready for it, and it kinda works well when the two can't hide their feelings for each other every time, sure they don't want to do it, but it's their love for each is so strong and it is impossible to ignore it and the only way they can resolve it is expressing each other, and love is so strong that it merge the wol rods because of their love. the people who were being salty about it needs to get a life and needs to understand that the last season is not terrible, it's like they're missing and they're even worse than toxic voltron fans. So overall, the last season isn't big like season three, but it was a thrilling ride and a big wrap up for the show and we will never forget the adventures in mewni. So this is a good season after all."", ""Though the show's epic final season has moments where the relationship drama and fillers get strained, it still wraps up it's impressive overall plot in a neat magical bow."", 'Pretty much throws away what the past seasons were constructing, and ends it in a mediocre way that has no sense of satisfaction whatsoever.', 'Acredito que a melhor forma de dar minha opinião é respondendo as críticas dos demais. Pelo que vejo a maioria das pessoas que criticaram essa temporada não entenderam pontos cruciais da trama. Eu compreendo que desde a terceira temporada o desenho já tinha uma tendência de apelar para questões sociais fora do universo da série (fazendo episódios inteiros para analogias com problemas sociais do mundo real), e sim concordo que isso é algo ruim, isso quebra a imersão do telespectador na história, contudo discordo que isso seja algo significativo, é apenas um detalhes incômodo. Sobre as reclamações de romance adolescente e desleixo com personagens segundários, creio que esses críticos não compreenderam que a história é sobre a adolescência da Star, se voltarem no primeiro episódio inclusive vão ver que a Star começa narrando, não faz sentido os personagens de segundo planos serem deixados de lado no final e toda atenção ser focada no romance dela com o Marcos, se ela amava ele e tudo estava uma bagunça era óbvio que ela só ia focar nele, e como é a história dela do ponto de vista dela, se ela estava focada nele logo os episódios focariam na relação dos dois, quem reclama disso é por que não prestou atenção.\nOutra crítica que eu tenho certeza que a pessoa não prestou atenção é em relação a Star ter causado a morte de vários seres e da Rainha Moon ser extremamente racista com os monstros, olha eu sugiro que revejam o desenho, a rainha Moon perdeu a mãe na adolescência em uma emboscada dos monstros, e depois disso guerreou boa parte da vida, é óbvio que ela vai ser preconceituosa, o mundo dela está em uma paz armada tem pouquíssimo tempo, ela perdeu muita gente na guerra, o estranho mesmo é ela ser tão compreensível, no mundo real as pessoas são muito piores que aquilo por motivos menores, e não posso deixar de falar da reclamação da Star ter matado tantos seres, sinceramente eu acredito que quem comentou isso não prestou atenção, o desenho é feito no formato para crianças e conta do ponto de vista da Star que é basicamente uma criança, mas se analisarem os detalhes, aquele mundo é mais sangrento que Game of Thrones kkkkkkk, quando a Star vai pedir ajuda dos pombos, é feito uma ironia no final, ""você não viu os corpos pelo castelo enquanto corria?"", e se voltarem as cenas e prestar atenção da pra ver que tem muito corpo, outro episódio é quando o Sapo Musculoso e a Rainha Moon discutem sobre quem comia/destruia os bebês de quem, e nos episódios posteriores fica subentendido que os dois falavam a verdade, e claro se prestar atenção verá que a expectativa de vida das rainhas é extremamente curta e que elas frequentemente tomam atitudes em nome do bem maior, a decisão da Star não foi maluca, e ninguém acharia estranho, naquele mundo, naquele universo, esse tipo de coisa é extremamente normal.\n\nEnfim, creio que da para perceber que do meu ponto de vista a quarta temporada é boa, tem seus erros, alguns incômodos, mas de forma geral ela finaliza de forma incrível, muitas coisas ficam em aberto, a maioria é respondida nos livros do desenho, compreendo que a Disney não permitiu mais do que quatro temporadas, mas mesmo assim a quarta temporada finaliza de forma ideal, fica claro o amor dos dois, assim como o fato de que as aventuras não acabaram, mostra o amadurecimento da Star no ápice, assim como o amor dois que de fato era verdadeiro, em resumo, os pontos principais foram finalizados e bem finalizados, tudo fez sentido se prestarmos atenção naquele mundo.', 'Too much of it was spent on mindless shipping and time wasting and then the actual plot was too rushed to be any good. It had great potential but there was no foreshadowing or hinting and too many characters have 180 turns in their personalities without any hinting, throwing away any character development and a terrible ending which is fine until you stop and think about it.', ""It was incredibly painful to watch such a great show fall from grace. This season replaced the funny, charming, and relatable elements the show once had with lots of unrealistic teen romance drama and a boring racism plot. The background characters, who were once filled with personality, are now mindlessly racist for the sake of a long, uniteresting plot about racism. Other side characters, like Rhombulus and Moon, were now lame villains for this racism plot. Plus, the final villain is the worst villain of the show. Mina Loveberry is such a boring villain, who isn't intimidating in the slightest. The writers could have made her a better villain by exploring her backstory a bit more, but decided not to and to instead focus on teen romance. The romance this season was done horribly, as characters got together and broke up for no reason other than the writers desire for Starco. The best characters were seriously underused, and the main characters became genuinely unlikable."", 'Although it seemed a bit rushed at times, likely due to the creators trying to tie up plots before the ending, the final few episodes tied together most points and the finale left me satisfied and heartbroken to see it ending.', ""Last episode meh but it's good"", ""This season was an incredibly disapointing end to one of my favorite shows ever. The whole thing feels rushed and plot points from previous seasons are just thrown out the window for new badly built plot points that just help to drag the show down. The creators of the show seemed to just shove any good plot out the window in favour of 'starco' which in the end dosent really work that well as its just thrown in out faces in favour of the relationships that are actually built up over time and work well. Characters who we have gotten a connection to in previous seasons are just thrown down the drain for no apparent reason in favour of making a mess of a 'plot'. And star in the end even commits multi-dimensional genocide WITH NO CONSEQUENCES FOR HER. Its just blown of that it is fine that she killed trillions of species and that she should be happy. Also they just forgot about toffee in favour of mina for some reason.\n\nIn the end I am really dissapointed and I do not recommend that you watch this season as it will just drag down everything from the previous seasons and leave you with a bad taste in your mouth."", 'An incredible season, a lot of drama and romance, I love that they have done this, although it had some failures, I could not help enjoying and waiting for the next episode, a beautiful but open ending, which leaves you wanting more. It will always be my favorite animated show, thanks to the entire cast for the love of this show.', ""I found this season to be different, not bad but different, and in many ways it was the most mature and disturbing season yet. There weren't the usual magical super villains but rather normal people and loved ones falling into villainy due to their ignorance and bigotry, and through their racism Mewnie devolves into inter-factional civil war. Their were hints at genocide through ethnic cleansing. (I have a background in history and global studies so what was clear as day for me may not be for everyone.)\n\nOf course the narrative was not as apocalyptically dark as I made it out to be. There are a bunch of comedic episodes (I wouldn't call them filler though). But the overall narrative was that of a world descending inexorably towards ethnic strife, despite Marco and Star's increasingly desperate efforts. \n\nThe ending, however, was fabulous and made me quite happy."", ""I don't know what happened with this season, oh wait I do! This season put mediocre teen drama and filler episodes over finishing the story, the finale still had more questions unanswered than answered, and most of the episodes are awful to pretty good when other seasons did so much better, an awful ending to this season, and why did they remove the continuity checker in the last 8 episodes or so, it turned out to be one giant mess."", 'Season 4 of ""Star vs. The forces of evil"" isn\'t as good as season 3. It still is a satisfying conclusion to one of my favorite shows.', ""I'm so sad it's over 😢"", ""Well I'm really saddened to see this show ending but sure everyone didn't like the ending...but I do. Sure it was quickly paced but although the plot is really interesting. And I have enjoyed the Starco kiss"", ""Although I still preferred the first and second seasons of this show about a magical princess from an alternate dimension, season 4 is a suitable finale to the show.\n\nThe best thing this season does is correct the weaknesses of the last one. When Star (voiced by The Middle's Eden Sher) moved back to Mewni from Earth, the show lost some energy , The Mewni storylines weren't as interesting. The writers course corrected here and I found myself entertained again. (The opening is a little weak. You spend an episode and a half with a bunch of one-note characters called the Pie Folk who are basically somewhat uncomfortable Romani (Gypsy) stereotypes). A lot more focus is on the monster/Mewman social and racial dynamics here and it really pays off. It serves as a really nuanced way to teach children about the dangers of and dealing with racism. All the previous elements of world building come together here. The ending to the show is really something.\n\nThis season focuses a lot more on the assorted cast rather than just Star, which helped a lot since they were losing steam on what to do with her. Star's dark and weird stuff-loving friend from Earth Janna (Abby Elliott) is a lot better incorporated in this season. However, fans of Ludo {Alan Tudyk), who was once a regular and the main villain, will be disappointed to see him basically get one episode. Though, he does get a proper wrap-up.\n\nThe last season felt a little too story heavy. This one focuses more on the humor. Plus, the dimension-hopping is back, which I missed.\n\nOverall, the show doesn't have quite the same comic energy as it started out with, but I am still impressed with the storytelling here."", 'Filled with pacing issues, a bad ending, and even a hint of sequelitus, Star Vs may come to a disappointing finale, but can still be considered a fun watch for fans of the previous seasons.', '2nd favourite season after the 3rd\nAmazing work and fantastic finale !!!', ""The worst season of the series. It started fine, but after the second half, the writing became so flawed that it was impossible not to notice it. I'm not even sure how people that came up with such good things in the past could think this was a good way to end the entire show."", 'Weakest season, not worth watching. Felt so forced. Sad it will end with everything being a huge mess.', 'its overtaking gravity falls', 'This season has brought with it a hyped climax and one that will surely pay off', 'By far the best season']",,,,1.0,0.0,0.0

I don't normally like twist villains but omni-man is done to perfection and the fights are absolutely breath taking. The side character get enough screen time for them to be likeable but not enough for them to be annoying and the other villains such as the mauler twins are very entertaining to watch and they are original which is what I like about invincible, its original. 5/5 I would recommend to everyone"", 'First half an episode was a bit roapy. Then boy did it take off. Excellent', 'Beautiful watch, it is peak', 'A perfect adaptation of a perfect comic.', ""the whole show is so heavy! gives the boys' vibes."", 'This is like the boys with way less political commentary.', 'Invincible couples fantastic writing with convincing performances, but the show\'s persistent edginess risks a parade of cringy self-seriousness. It\'s clear that Amazon aimed at a college-age demographic; those who\'d lap up the subversion of genre conventions, the over-indulgent gore, and the wayward moodiness of young-adult life. Taken with ""The Boys"", Amazon\'s strategy to claim their corner of the superhero market is becoming increasingly transparent.  Fortunately, this atmosphere of pseudo-profundity is frequently upstaged by some of the best storytelling to come out of the superhero genre of late.', 'This series was a good twist from the normal action hero genre.  A lot of the events are unpredictable and they must leave cliff hangers because I binge watched this in 2 sittings.  Very good!\n\n Looking forward to Season 2.', ""This was everything dc couldn't be!! Fantastic show"", 'I saw the fight scene from the end of the first episode in a Youtube video and came to the show looking for more of that. I was subsequently disappointed, since none of the other action could even compare to that scene. And the action is sparse, only sprinkled on top of the teen drama and the ""tune in next time""-style mystery that this show offers.', ""amazing, can't wait for season 2. Steven Yeun's best work since he left The Walking Dead."", ""Epicly Insane!\nIt was funny,emotional,blooddy stastifying with gore and action and the animation is top tier with an awesome soundtrack, each and every character was amazingly developed and the teenage stuff was fun, the story and the twists specially the 1st episode's it was surprising and the ending it was cold and satisfying,Overall its an epic Masterpiece!"", ""One of those over the top gore action cartoons, but with a twist. These are all rip-offs of known super heroes done with no shame. I enjoyed the first season, and I'm looking forward to the second."", 'This is a brilliant show, highly recommend.', 'What is it with Amazon and Comics, The Boys is awesome as is this animated take on Invincible.', ""Invincible is a great show that is set in earth that is filled with super hero's and villains. The show follows a kid named invincible who's dad is Omni-Man, the greatest superhero in the world. In the first episode Omni-Man kills every member of the guardians of the globe, which was a group of superheroes like the adventures, and it is not revealed why he did this until the end. This does a great job a setting up Omni-Man as the villain with this seemingly senseless act of violence. The other characters in this show don't know that Omni-Man is evil which creates a ton of suspense when he is in the scenes. When invincible started training with his dad, it makes you horrified because what Omni-Man is capable of doing to him. This continues throughout the entire show and it creates a masive payoff when Omni-Man and invincible finally fight. It is revealed that Omni-Man never cared about earth or its people, he was on earth for the sole purpose of helping his people take control of earth. He shows that he doesn't feel anything for the human race by killing hundreds of humans for no reason. Omni-Man is obviously stronger and shows this by beating his son nearly to death, but when he wins but is unable to kill his son and this shows that he has some humanity. The reasons I love this show is it's good animation, complex characters, unexpected twist along with good story telling, and finally it is one of the few shows that when I started watching it was nearly impossible to stop."", ""Unfortunately, there isn't much to say about the series, as almost everything is a spolier.

The ingredients are already there.

No, this is humor, mystery, drama, romance and science fiction, all rolled up into one absolutely addictive treat.', 'This lurid animated series combines the levity of a classic coming-of-age comedy with the trend of increasingly gritty superhero dramas.', 'It may not have the spectacle of a grand, VFX-embellished live-action entertainer to show off, but this little show does manage to hold its own nonetheless.', ""With its fun '80s-inspired animation style and stellar voice cast, Invincible is worth checking out for superhero genre fans.

Deep down, it is great, grade-A, solid, relatable, interesting character storytelling."", 'Replete with a solid score and many sequences of character development, Invincible relishes action sequences and character interactions as much as it does explicit gore, all with a wicked sense of humor.', ""I'm definitely inclined to keep watching. But the producers will have to work hard to ensure that the 40- to 45-minute episodes (the same length as an hourlong TV show with commercials) don't start to feel bloated."", ""A dark superhero series with similar beats you've seen before if you love the genre.

The result is a fun yet dark show about the cost of being a teenage superhero.', ""Despite the frequent spattering of blood, Invincible doesn't otherwise aim to be lurid for the sake of it. Instead, it's got a story with nuance and heart."", ""'Invincible' is ridiculously violent, but at the center of its superhero satire is a coming of age story surprisingly full of heart."", ""Some of the series' devices now seem less fresh than they did in 2003... but the show combats this by devoting serious screen time to building out the dynamics between its characters in ways big and small."", 'But both the jokes and the character beats that fuel Invincible are too sporadic to make the series feel anything more than sputtering.

That sense of familiarity doesn't necessarily undermine Invincible on its merits, but it does make the exercise unavoidably feel a bit been there, seen that."", ""...it's nice to see at least one superhero property at least trying to capture the full spectrum of what makes us so annoyingly obsessed with them."", ""Invincible is okay. As a piece of early 2000s nostalgia, it's fun enough, but it's just too dated, too cliche, and almost a bit too earnest to stand out in an entertainment landscape already packed with superhero entertainment."", 'I was impressed with how well it represents the classic spirit of the genre while simultaneously exceeding expectations, accommodating modern sensibilities without sacrificing personality.

Voice cast is particularly strong, great to see Steven Yeun as lead.', 'As an animated entry presented as seriously as necessary while maintaining a grand sense of humor, Invincible has plenty to offer and is just getting started.', 'What both anchors and keeps Invincible compelling is its cast, packed to the brim with talent. As Mark, Yeun conveys a perfect combination of teenage insecurity, determination and occasional arrogance.', 'This is everything I wanted The Boys series to be. An incisive, unblinking, shocking, and bloody look at the downside of superheroes and it has jokes too. I cannot wait to inhale the rest of the series', 'The end result is bewildering, but also exhilarating, injecting energy into a simple power fantasy premise even as it carries the potential to alienate viewers looking for lighter fare.', 'Like a good superhero comic, Invincible understands the value of unexpected twists and cliffhangers. And, like any comic hoping to keep its audience, it knows the value of getting off to a strong start.', ""For now, we'll simply say that Invincible is one of the best new shows for genre fans and a worthy addition to the oversaturated superhero market."", ""One of the best things about Invincible, though, is its stellar voice performances. While a lot of major characters get a chance to shine in the first three episodes, Steven Yeun's turn as Mark Grayson is particularly noteworthy."", ""While the first three episodes made available for review don't quite sell the idea that Invincible has much new to bring to the genre, they will certainly speak to longstanding fans who've been waiting for this adaptation for years."", 'I think Amazon has something great on their hands.

They're the reason to watch."", ""The more extreme content can feel like Invincible is trying too hard to seem older, just in a different way from its title character. Still, it's fun, and Yeun, Simmons, and Oh make for a strong central ensemble."", ""A faithful, epic, violent and wildly fun adaptation of Robert Kirkman's comic."", 'Invincible is brutally violent, darkly comedic, and is one of the greatest animated superhero shows to be released. From beginning to its final moments Episode 1 sets the bar.', ""There are still some good bones to its premise, and just enough subversiveness to let you ignore the fact this is a story you've seen a hundred times before."", 'These first episodes are a great primer for the series with good animation, good characters, and solid twists and turns.', ""This superhero show may play it a bit safer than The Boys, which won't help it stand out in the current landscape of superhero content, but for now, it works and should satisfy fans of the comic, even if it doesn't reinvent the wheel."", 'Invincible is a truly gigantic story encompassing a ton of characters and subplots, and with hope the show will be able to achieve that same sense of scope.', ""Invincible has so much heart and meaning behind those punches that the show leaves an impact even when it isn't throwing blood and severed limbs in your face."", 'Every single frame of this beautifully animated series is just down right stupendous...', 'Totally worth checking out... especially if you want a different look at what it means to be a superhero and what can come of it.', ""Its characters aren't developed enough to fill the enormous gap between approach and appearance. However, its central mystery offers enough questions, and enough promise, to keep viewers watching."", ""While it might seem like the dark superhero trend is overdone, 'Invincible' is exciting, beautifully animated, and buoyed by a killer voice cast led by Steven Yeun."", 'Balls to the wall action combined with a stellar voice cast make Invincible a must-watch new animated series, even if comic book fans will find much of what plays out on screen to be somewhat familiar.', ""Five minutes into its first episode, you'd be forgiven for thinking Invincible is just another superhero story, but in fact, it might be the best one you see all year."", 'Fans of the comics will be instantly hooked -- and those that know nothing about them?

The villains of the second season were two Inquisitors and Darth Vader. The villains of the third season were DARTH MAUL AND GRAND ADMIRAL THRAWN. So what were the two villains who would top DARTH MAUL and GRAND ADMIRAL THRAWN? Uh, some governor lady and some ninja. And yes, the last episode is one of the best in the show. But a bunch of people told me that my complaint that you never see anyone with a face die onscreen wasn\'t true because ""Kanan dies in season four!"" Uh, well, a few things. He died in a cut-screen. Ezra couldn\'t die because he\'s like the main character, Disney\'s too proud of their ""Strong Female Character"" in Sabine to kill her, Hera\'s technically in Rogue One so she can\'t die, and Zeb\'s comic relief, so Kanan had to die because he\'s the mentor. And third, HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY KILLING KANAN WHEN THERE WAS AN ENTIRE EPISODE RIGHT AFTER IT BASICALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW GOOD KANAN WAS? HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT IT WAS GOOD THAT THEY DID THAT WHEN THIS EPISODE EXISTS!!!!!', ""Space Aladdin without Genie. It's really bad.

After the insultingly terrible The Last Jedi I was not in the mood for anymore Disney hijinks. The end was okay. It could have been better, and more epic, but at least no characters were destroyed. I was seriously hoping that every one of the characters would be killed off to prevent Disney from ruining them in some future atrocity like they did to Han Luke and Leia. They did kill one great character, and I was very glad the he\x92s safe now. That\x92s what Disney\x92s legacy for Star Wars is now: I hope that the great characters are killed before some auteur can turn them into parodies of themselves. Anyway, the end is serviceable as far as it goes.', 'For me, the words that best describe Rebels are \x93trite,\x94 \x94stereotypical,\x94 \x93deos ex machina\x94 and \x93sloppy.\x94 Others have complained online how much some of the characters are \x93Mary-Sues,\x94 so I won\x92t elaborate on that. Basically, this has got to be some of the most lazy story telling I have seen, since probably the prequels.', 'Years of development on Filonis side come together beautifully in the final season of Rebels, and add a lot fo emotion, drama and tons of lore that will (again) satisfy hard core fans, little kids and everyone else.', ""Beautiful show - so sad to see it go. But hopefully, especially considering the way it ended, this won't be the end."", ""a childish disney version of star wars. It's apparent that Filoni and others were fans of the franchise and included artwork, characters, and music from better parts of the extended universe.

The villains of the second season were two Inquisitors and Darth Vader. The villains of the third season were DARTH MAUL AND GRAND ADMIRAL THRAWN.

He's still bumbling around for way too much of this show, but at least he develops some leadership qualities. The animation style also seems to get better. Some of the planets and starships are absolutely breathtaking and some of the most beautiful and interesting in all of Star Wars.

It seemed really childish and the animation and writing weren't on-par with the other Star Wars animated series. However, I remember feeling the same way about Rebels and even The Clone Wars when those shows first started, so I defended it on the grounds that the show would likely mature with its audience and get darker and more dramatic as the series progressed. By the end of the first season, that seemed to be the direction the show was going in. One of the main characters joins the First Order and now our heroes are on the run. What's going to happen next?? Mostly a bunch of stupid standalone adventures that don't really progress the plot or develop the characters. Yeah, the second season felt really meandering compared to the first season, most of the episodes didn't even have the main conflict set up at the end of the first season in them. Then it shows up again, and then the show just kinda ends before it really even got a chance to begin. This show was a whole lot of nothing, ultimately. For a show titled Star Wars Resistance, it does not really give any larger context to the Resistance and the sequel era the way Rebels did for the Rebellion and the originals or The Clone Wars did for the Republic and the prequels. It feels weirdly separate, most of the show technically doesn't even have the Resistance in it. It feels more like LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures than Rebels. To be very honest, I believe this show was cancelled behind the scenes. I think the show was supposed to go on for longer, but was cancelled prematurely because it wasn't successful enough. I don't have any evidence to back that up, but it just feels that way to me. There are some strengths to the show, the voice acting is good, it's designed well, the main setting is very well-developed and the characters are likeable and memorable, but that's still not enough to make up for the lacklustre writing. Overall, if you really like Star Wars and are starved for new content, check it out. Otherwise, I'd say skip it unless you're under the age of 12, but even then I'd recommend Rebels and The Clone Wars over this show any day. Very disappointing."", 'Ultimately disappointing.

Instead of main character Kaz (Christopher Sean) just hanging around the station, actual stuff happens. Now that everyone's directly under the threat of the First Order, they're on a mission to survive which produces more interesting material. We get to visit multiple places and more out of several of the characters, especially the station's main pilots.\n\nHowever, unlike Star Wars Rebels which started out a little basic in the first season and then kicked things up in the second season, Resistence is content to be just a basic kids show. The episodes are mostly just decent. The big plot point from the last season finale isn't as interesting as you'd think it would be. The final episode of the show is also just okay lacking the large sense of conclusion that Rebels had. Also, you'd think they'd do an episode about Kaz's difficult father. This plot point was set up at the very beginning but nothing happens from it.\n\nThe kids will still like this. There's nothing really downright bad about any of this, but it isn't crucial material for Star Wars fans either."", 'Truly not worth anything besides some mindless reminder that the House of Mouse made this garbage.

The final arc probably could have been released on it's own as a movie because these first eight episodes are pretty much a drag compared to the finale.

The second arc... is ironically some of the worst this show has to offer, while the story it's self isn't really that bad (more standard clone wars filler like the bad batch), the characters (specifically the 2 sisters) are so unlikable, cliche, annoying, and forgettable the only thing i can remember about them is that one is a bad pilot and the other is an idiot and i hate them both.

I hated Ahsoka Tano but as I watched the episodes and seasons I became a fan. The last 4 epsiode of this season is really extraordinary. This is absolut a different level what have seen from SW saga since the Disney had take over the LF.  I have to say Dave Filoni is genius at telling stories. And this is the most important. It dosent matter to have visually great a show or a movie (even a sci-fi) if the quality of the characters and depth of the story is lacking.

Thankfully, Disney listened the the strong fan base and created this seventh season. \n\nPersonally, I did not think that the first part of the episodes was very good. It was filled with the same corny Star Wars that was seen in the most recent trilogy. BUT, the last four episodes are absolutely spectacular. They weave perfectly into the cannon of Episode II and III without disrupting anything distastefully. I'm not usually one who is attracted to animation, but it was so well done that I caught myself admiring the work. This paired with an incredible score with a refreshed tone mimicking some of the themes in Episode III creates a deeply emotional experience (if you're a Star Wars junkie). \n\nOverall, the last four episodes are what make this season truly special. The other episodes set up the four part movie to be something truly awesome. I could not have asked for anything more.

The first one is about the Bad Batch, a group of clones that gained certain special abilities do to a genetic difference in their DNA. This arc is pretty good. The second arc is about Ahsoka and the Martez sisters. They get in some mishaps, and it goes into depth about how some people really feel about the Jedi. This arc is decent. The final arc is about the Siege of Mandalore and Order 66. My god, this arc is absolutely fantastic. It brings about so many emotions throughout it. It makes you feel happy, sad, nostalgic, amused, and depressed. The music used in the arc is absolutely fantastic, and is some of Kevin Kiner's best work. It ties in perfectly with the events of Revenge of the Sith, and by the end, it leaves you feeling depressed. The entire arc truly feels like a movie split into 4 parts. The Siege of Mandalore arc is what The Rise of Skywalker should've been: epic, full of passion, and emotional. I can talk about how good the arc is for days, rambling on and on. \nIn conclusion, this is the REAL finale to content in the Skywalker Saga.

We all know how bad the sister arc was so I'll skip that. The last four episodes however were a huge disappointment to me. First off Ashoka acted like a little kid for awhile complaining how the Jedi won't give her troops even though she isn't a Jedi anymore and the Republic is under attack. I feel like the last 2 episodes could've been pushed together and that we can have an episode seeing how Rex and Ashoka deal with things after order 66. Also why is it that only Rex shows emotion, it's a very sad time and he is the only one who cares. It makes no sense that Ashoka wouldn't kill the clones at first because she doesn't even know that they aren't in control, hell even Rex is ready to shoot his own brothers but Ashoka tells him no.

The final arc probably could have been released on it's own as a movie because these first eight episodes are pretty much a drag compared to the finale. The first arc is the Bad Batch which by all standard is an OK, arc 6.5/10 but its not really final season material(plus it's just setting up a spin off show so yeah). The second arc... is ironically some of the worst this show has to offer, while the story it's self isn't really that bad (more standard clone wars filler like the bad batch), the characters (specifically the 2 sisters) are so unlikable, cliche, annoying, and forgettable the only thing i can remember about them is that one is a bad pilot and the other is an idiot and i hate them both. It's also extremely disappointing since this is the first time we see Ashoka since season 5 and she comeback in this disappointing, drawn out, crap fest, that is barely entertaining and 100% SKIP ABLE LITERALLY YOU DON'T REALLY EVEN NEED TO WATCH IT FOR THE FINAL ARC OF THE SEASON. 2/10 the only thing i can say that is positive is a few of the jar jar episodes are worse, but just a few.

This is absolut a different level what have seen from SW saga since the Disney had take over the LF.  I have to say Dave Filoni is genius at telling stories. And this is the most important. It dosent matter to have visually great a show or a movie (even a sci-fi) if the quality of the characters and depth of the story is lacking.

Thankfully, Disney listened the the strong fan base and created this seventh season. \n\nPersonally, I did not think that the first part of the episodes was very good. It was filled with the same corny Star Wars that was seen in the most recent trilogy. BUT, the last four episodes are absolutely spectacular. They weave perfectly into the cannon of Episode II and III without disrupting anything distastefully. I'm not usually one who is attracted to animation, but it was so well done that I caught myself admiring the work. This paired with an incredible score with a refreshed tone mimicking some of the themes in Episode III creates a deeply emotional experience (if you're a Star Wars junkie). \n\nOverall, the last four episodes are what make this season truly special. The other episodes set up the four part movie to be something truly awesome. I could not have asked for anything more.

The first one is about the Bad Batch, a group of clones that gained certain special abilities do to a genetic difference in their DNA. This arc is pretty good. The second arc is about Ahsoka and the Martez sisters. They get in some mishaps, and it goes into depth about how some people really feel about the Jedi. This arc is decent. The final arc is about the Siege of Mandalore and Order 66. My god, this arc is absolutely fantastic. It brings about so many emotions throughout it. It makes you feel happy, sad, nostalgic, amused, and depressed. The music used in the arc is absolutely fantastic, and is some of Kevin Kiner's best work. It ties in perfectly with the events of Revenge of the Sith, and by the end, it leaves you feeling depressed. The entire arc truly feels like a movie split into 4 parts. The Siege of Mandalore arc is what The Rise of Skywalker should've been: epic, full of passion, and emotional. I can talk about how good the arc is for days, rambling on and on. \nIn conclusion, this is the REAL finale to content in the Skywalker Saga.

We all know how bad the sister arc was so I'll skip that. The last four episodes however were a huge disappointment to me. First off Ashoka acted like a little kid for awhile complaining how the Jedi won't give her troops even though she isn't a Jedi anymore and the Republic is under attack. I feel like the last 2 episodes could've been pushed together and that we can have an episode seeing how Rex and Ashoka deal with things after order 66. Also why is it that only Rex shows emotion, it's a very sad time and he is the only one who cares. It makes no sense that Ashoka wouldn't kill the clones at first because she doesn't even know that they aren't in control, hell even Rex is ready to shoot his own brothers but Ashoka tells him no.

The second arc... is ironically some of the worst this show has to offer, while the story it's self isn't really that bad (more standard clone wars filler like the bad batch), the characters (specifically the 2 sisters) are so unlikable, cliche, annoying, and forgettable the only thing i can remember about them is that one is a bad pilot and the other is an idiot and i hate them both.

It dosent matter to have visually great a show or a movie (even a sci-fi) if the quality of the characters and depth of the story is lacking.

It was filled with the same corny Star Wars that was seen in the most recent trilogy. BUT, the last four episodes are absolutely spectacular. They weave perfectly into the cannon of Episode II and III without disrupting anything distastefully. I'm not usually one who is attracted to animation, but it was so well done that I caught myself admiring the work. This paired with an incredible score with a refreshed tone mimicking some of the themes in Episode III creates a deeply emotional experience (if you're a Star Wars junkie). \n\nOverall, the last four episodes are what make this season truly special.

The first one is about the Bad Batch, a group of clones that gained certain special abilities do to a genetic difference in their DNA. This arc is pretty good. The second arc is about Ahsoka and the Martez sisters. They get in some mishaps, and it goes into depth about how some people really feel about the Jedi. This arc is decent. The final arc is about the Siege of Mandalore and Order 66. My god, this arc is absolutely fantastic. It brings about so many emotions throughout it. It makes you feel happy, sad, nostalgic, amused, and depressed. The music used in the arc is absolutely fantastic, and is some of Kevin Kiner's best work. It ties in perfectly with the events of Revenge of the Sith, and by the end, it leaves you feeling depressed. The entire arc truly feels like a movie split into 4 parts. The Siege of Mandalore arc is what The Rise of Skywalker should've been: epic, full of passion, and emotional.

First off Ashoka acted like a little kid for awhile complaining how the Jedi won't give her troops even though she isn't a Jedi anymore and the Republic is under attack. I feel like the last 2 episodes could've been pushed together and that we can have an episode seeing how Rex and Ashoka deal with things after order 66. Also why is it that only Rex shows emotion, it's a very sad time and he is the only one who cares. It makes no sense that Ashoka wouldn't kill the clones at first because she doesn't even know that they aren't in control, hell even Rex is ready to shoot his own brothers but Ashoka tells him no.

The final arc probably could have been released on it's own as a movie because these first eight episodes are pretty much a drag compared to the finale. The first arc is the Bad Batch which by all standard is an OK, arc 6.5/10 but its not really final season material(plus it's just setting up a spin off show so yeah). The second arc... is ironically some of the worst this show has to offer, while the story it's self isn't really that bad (more standard clone wars filler like the bad batch), the characters (specifically the 2 sisters) are so unlikable, cliche, annoying, and forgettable the only thing i can remember about them is that one is a bad pilot and the other is an idiot and i hate them both. It's also extremely disappointing since this is the first time we see Ashoka since season 5 and she comeback in this disappointing, drawn out, crap fest, that is barely entertaining and 100% SKIP ABLE LITERALLY YOU DON'T REALLY EVEN NEED TO WATCH IT FOR THE FINAL ARC OF THE SEASON. 2/10 the only thing i can say that is positive is a few of the jar jar episodes are worse, but just a few.

It dosent matter to have visually great a show or a movie (even a sci-fi) if the quality of the characters and depth of the story is lacking.

It was filled with the same corny Star Wars that was seen in the most recent trilogy. BUT, the last four episodes are absolutely spectacular. They weave perfectly into the cannon of Episode II and III without disrupting anything distastefully. I'm not usually one who is attracted to animation, but it was so well done that I caught myself admiring the work. This paired with an incredible score with a refreshed tone mimicking some of the themes in Episode III creates a deeply emotional experience (if you're a Star Wars junkie). \n\nOverall, the last four episodes are what make this season truly special.

The second arc is about Ahsoka and the Martez sisters. They get in some mishaps, and it goes into depth about how some people really feel about the Jedi. This arc is decent. The final arc is about the Siege of Mandalore and Order 66. My god, this arc is absolutely fantastic. It brings about so many emotions throughout it. It makes you feel happy, sad, nostalgic, amused, and depressed. The music used in the arc is absolutely fantastic, and is some of Kevin Kiner's best work. It ties in perfectly with the events of Revenge of the Sith, and by the end, it leaves you feeling depressed. The entire arc truly feels like a movie split into 4 parts. The Siege of Mandalore arc is what The Rise of Skywalker should've been: epic, full of passion, and emotional.

I feel like the last 2 episodes could've been pushed together and that we can have an episode seeing how Rex and Ashoka deal with things after order 66. Also why is it that only Rex shows emotion, it's a very sad time and he is the only one who cares. It makes no sense that Ashoka wouldn't kill the clones at first because she doesn't even know that they aren't in control, hell even Rex is ready to shoot his own brothers but Ashoka tells him no.

The final arc probably could have been released on it's own as a movie because these first eight episodes are pretty much a drag compared to the finale. The first arc is the Bad Batch which by all standard is an OK, arc 6.5/10 but its not really final season material(plus it's just setting up a spin off show so yeah). The second arc... is ironically some of the worst this show has to offer, while the story it's self isn't really that bad (more standard clone wars filler like the bad batch), the characters (specifically the 2 sisters) are so unlikable, cliche, annoying, and forgettable the only thing i can remember about them is that one is a bad pilot and the other is an idiot and i hate them both. It's also extremely disappointing since this is the first time we see Ashoka since season 5 and she comeback in this disappointing, drawn out, crap fest, that is barely entertaining and 100% SKIP ABLE LITERALLY YOU DON'T REALLY EVEN NEED TO WATCH IT FOR THE FINAL ARC OF THE SEASON. 2/10 the only thing i can say that is positive is a few of the jar jar episodes are worse, but just a few.

It dosent matter to have visually great a show or a movie (even a sci-fi) if the quality of the characters and depth of the story is lacking.

It was filled with the same corny Star Wars that was seen in the most recent trilogy. BUT, the last four episodes are absolutely spectacular. They weave perfectly into the cannon of Episode II and III without disrupting anything distastefully. I'm not usually one who is attracted to animation, but it was so well done that I caught myself admiring the work. This paired with an incredible score with a refreshed tone mimicking some of the themes in Episode III creates a deeply emotional experience (if you're a Star Wars junkie). \n\nOverall, the last four episodes are what make this season truly special.

The first one is about the Bad Batch, a group of clones that gained certain special abilities do to a genetic difference in their DNA. This arc is pretty good. The second arc is about Ahsoka and the Martez sisters. They get in some mishaps, and it goes into depth about how some people really feel about the Jedi. This arc is decent. The final arc is about the Siege of Mandalore and Order 66. My god, this arc is absolutely fantastic. It brings about so many emotions throughout it. It makes you feel happy, sad, nostalgic, amused, and depressed. The music used in the arc is absolutely fantastic, and is some of Kevin Kiner's best work. It ties in perfectly with the events of Revenge of the Sith, and by the end, it leaves you feeling depressed. The entire arc truly feels like a movie split into 4 parts. The Siege of Mandalore arc is what The Rise of Skywalker should've been: epic, full of passion, and emotional.

First off Ashoka acted like a little kid for awhile complaining how the Jedi won't give her troops even though she isn't a Jedi anymore and the Republic is under attack. I feel like the last 2 episodes could've been pushed together and that we can have an episode seeing how Rex and Ashoka deal with things after order 66. Also why is it that only Rex shows emotion, it's a very sad time and he is the only one who cares. It makes no sense that Ashoka wouldn't kill the clones at first because she doesn't even know that they aren't in control, hell even Rex is ready to shoot his own brothers but Ashoka tells him no.

The first arc is the Bad Batch which by all standard is an OK, arc 6.5/10 but its not really final season material(plus it's just setting up a spin off show so yeah). The second arc... is ironically some of the worst this show has to offer, while the story it's self isn't really that bad (more standard clone wars filler like the bad batch), the characters (specifically the 2 sisters) are so unlikable, cliche, annoying, and forgettable the only thing i can remember about them is that one is a bad pilot and the other is an idiot and i hate them both. It's also extremely disappointing since this is the first time we see Ashoka since season 5 and she comeback in this disappointing, drawn out, crap fest, that is barely entertaining and 100% SKIP ABLE LITERALLY YOU DON'T REALLY EVEN NEED TO WATCH IT FOR THE FINAL ARC OF THE SEASON. 2/10 the only thing i can say that is positive is a few of the jar jar episodes are worse, but just a few. In conclusion, what could have been the best star wars movie ever, is turned into a short season bogged down by filler and unnecessary garbage. I would have honestly given this 5/5 stars if those DUMB sister episodes didn't exist."", ""Clone Wars was interesting. Apart from maybe 20 episodes in 7 seasons, all the rest is fun to watch. You learn a lot about the lore of Star Wars. It's a deeper look at the passage from the second movie to the order 66. Amazing work of animation, mix with character development. The rhythm of the episodes are frantic. I feel like the timeline and the movies are better justified with this series. I give it 82%. A must watch to know more about SW. Season 6 and 7 were the best."", 'the last 4 episodes are some of the best start wars anything i have seen.', 'No joke, the final season of the Clone Wars is one of the best entries in the Star Wars universe hands down- all thanks to brilliant characterization, awesome animation and  some truly jaw-dropping action sequences all making for the perfect conclusion to a fantastic series.', 'Amazing conclusion to an amazing series.', ""This is the MOST heartbreaking season of any series I've ever seen. I cant stop crying when I get reminded of it... Its just so good and so sad!"", 'One of the best seasons in the Clone Wars Series. With beautiful story telling, beautiful animation, with a breathtaking score, Season 7 leaves viewers satisfied while leaving them yearning for more.', ""Even though there was a below average amount of episodes, they were above average in performance. The 4 episodes with the Martez sisters were some of the weakest episodes in a while, that out of the way, I can forgive those poor episodes because of the siege of Mandalore episodes (Last 4) were the best episodes of Star Wars the Clone Wars in the entire show. And the perfect conclusion to the show! Sorry G.O.T you've been beaten."", 'Clone Wars Season 7 was an amazing last season of this amazing show. The first arc about the Bad Batch were well done. While the next arc about Ahsoka and the sisters isn\'t as good but still adds some depth to Ahsoka. The final four episode arc ""Siege of Mandalore"" we see how Ahsoka and Rex dealt with Order 66 and serves as a perfect ending to the series.', ""I've watched every show and movie, read every book and comic. EVERYTHING. and I have never come across a show that is as good as this one. It is by far as a kid the show that made me love star wars as much as I do. This last season is everything you could have ever wanted in a wrap up to this amazing godsend. Dave Filoni is the lord to all nerds I bow down to you."", ""This is one of the best ways to end The Clone Wars, CGI is brilliant, from beginning to end of The Final Season it's crazy good."", 'One of the bests shows ever made.', 'After a throwaway clone-focused first arc, and a genuinely honest-but frustratingly slow-second one, the final arc alone is Clone Wars at its all-out peak, all with top-of-the-line animation, great direction, and an ultimately satisfying sense of scope!', 'The Bad Batch would deserve 4 or 3 1/2 stars. It was a fun welcome back but not final season material. The sisters arc was definitely not the best, 3 stars. But the siege of Mandalore is some of the best stuff ever PERIOD. Would give the siege of mandalore alone 66 stars out of 5.', 'The best ""Star Wars"" stories since many years! The final four episodes are really fantastic!! The proper remedy after the disaster of movie Part 8 and the ludicrous ending of Part 9.\nSo, it is now proven: ""Star Wars"" can easily have female protagonists to lead, when the story is good and relevant to all that has already happened to the ""Star Wars\'s"" universe and the character is fully developed. Every misstep of movies 7-9 has been avoided.\nI was happy to reconnect with the franchise, hopeful that there will be a season 8 or at least a continuance of ""Rebels"".', 'Valió la pena la espera, con una animación mejorada y envidiable la temporada final hizo justicia a tan querida serie, con un final agridulce y un último capítulo bastante emotivo que incluso despierta nostalgia al devolvernos a la primera que vez que vimos la Venganza de los Sith. Bien logrado!! 👏', 'A brilliant last season for a beloved season. \n\nSeason 7 gives us some of the most beautifully animated and heart wrenching scenes of the series, with a lot of fan-serving moments and a clear love for the franchise from its producers.', 'the sister arc is not really good the ending is great the animation awsome', 'I did not like this show when it have started many years ago. I hated Ahsoka Tano but as I watched the episodes and seasons I became a fan. The last 4 epsiode of this season is really extraordinary. This is absolut a different level what have seen from SW saga since the Disney had take over the LF.  I have to say Dave Filoni is genius at telling stories. And this is the most important. It dosent matter to have visually great a show or a movie (even a sci-fi) if the quality of the characters and depth of the story is lacking. He built up the best character (Ahsoka) in SW universe and bring back the hope that the Disney is able to produce decent quality of SW story.', ""This is the caliber of Star Wars we've all been waiting for. I watched the first six seasons as a kid and was very disappointed when I found out that the series would be abruptly cut off because Disney bought Lucasfilm. Thankfully, Disney listened the the strong fan base and created this seventh season. \n\nPersonally, I did not think that the first part of the episodes was very good. It was filled with the same corny Star Wars that was seen in the most recent trilogy. BUT, the last four episodes are absolutely spectacular. They weave perfectly into the cannon of Episode II and III without disrupting anything distastefully. I'm not usually one who is attracted to animation, but it was so well done that I caught myself admiring the work. This paired with an incredible score with a refreshed tone mimicking some of the themes in Episode III creates a deeply emotional experience (if you're a Star Wars junkie). \n\nOverall, the last four episodes are what make this season truly special. The other episodes set up the four part movie to be something truly awesome. I could not have asked for anything more. This is the Star Wars we have been waiting for."", 'I would give it 5 star because of the final 4 but the Bad Batch was ok and the Trace and Rafa episodes were frickin garbage', 'The depth of the characters is amazing. Slow in parts but that adds gravitas to the final episodes. Well played', ""This is an absolutely incredible season. There are 3 story arcs in this season. The first one is about the Bad Batch, a group of clones that gained certain special abilities do to a genetic difference in their DNA. This arc is pretty good. The second arc is about Ahsoka and the Martez sisters. They get in some mishaps, and it goes into depth about how some people really feel about the Jedi. This arc is decent. The final arc is about the Siege of Mandalore and Order 66. My god, this arc is absolutely fantastic. It brings about so many emotions throughout it. It makes you feel happy, sad, nostalgic, amused, and depressed. The music used in the arc is absolutely fantastic, and is some of Kevin Kiner's best work. It ties in perfectly with the events of Revenge of the Sith, and by the end, it leaves you feeling depressed. The entire arc truly feels like a movie split into 4 parts. The Siege of Mandalore arc is what The Rise of Skywalker should've been: epic, full of passion, and emotional. I can talk about how good the arc is for days, rambling on and on. \nIn conclusion, this is the REAL finale to content in the Skywalker Saga. I highly recommend watching this over any sequel content."", 'Some part of the season fills way too much information, but in the end this is show truly represents what star wars is all about, faith.', 'The best season of the show.', ""This entire season was a masterpiece and Dave Filoni should be proud of it all. The ending was not as climactic as I wanted it to be but didn't leave much in the realm of loose ends."", ""It was not that good, only the bad batch arc is worth watching. We all know how bad the sister arc was so I'll skip that. The last four episodes however were a huge disappointment to me. First off Ashoka acted like a little kid for awhile complaining how the Jedi won't give her troops even though she isn't a Jedi anymore and the Republic is under attack. I feel like the last 2 episodes could've been pushed together and that we can have an episode seeing how Rex and Ashoka deal with things after order 66. Also why is it that only Rex shows emotion, it's a very sad time and he is the only one who cares. It makes no sense that Ashoka wouldn't kill the clones at first because she doesn't even know that they aren't in control, hell even Rex is ready to shoot his own brothers but Ashoka tells him no. If Rex is okay with it then Ashoka should to. Spoiler Alert but I really loved how they made the storm troopers look as well as Darth Vader.

The crew did a spectacular job in bringing the history of Walt Disney and the Disney theme parks to life.

I liked the score, it was really Disney toned.', 'Fanatico de los partes. Muchas partes emotivas. Algunas pocas aburridas. Resultado final muy atractivo.', ""Since I first read Baudrillard's critique of the Disneyland project (putting it briefly he thinks that Disneyland serves as a mean to convince people that their fake postmodern lives are real by showing them something even more fake) I deemed it as indefensible. And yet, lo and behold, such a defence has been undertaken, and in a form of a documentary TV series, no less. And what a defence it is! Disney, it seems, conquers all, and not only from the economical standpoint, but philosophical also. This series uncovers deep techeoretical fundaments of Disneyland conceived by Walt Disney himself and shows perfectly how and why they are working even now, so many years later. Watching it enriched my reflection on that subject and brought to my mind the idea that Baudrillard was, perhaps, not entirely right."", 'If you love Disney, or love to know how they created the parks and attractions, this is a must see.', 'Good series interesting to see the history of Disney.', 'If you like Disneyland, Disney World or Walt Disney in general, this is a must watch.

I would hope this part of Disney+ would never die out.', 'Probably the best show on Disney Plus The Imagineering Story provides an enjoyable and entertaining documentary explaining the creation of Disneys parks. While the show does not go too in depth with each park and attraction the 1st season focuses on the history of the parks and major attractions and hopefully future seasons go more in depth.', ""Really well done.

But behind the scenes it's much the same as BOBF which  got significantly lower ratings. From extended flashbacks to make up for lazy storytelling, campy dialogue and a Mandalorian that for some reason struggles to fight Jawas, the iconic bounty hunter/feared warriors of the galaxy have been reduced to the creators wet dream of old tv show styles and homages.

Cameos and obvious references don't make a show good."", 'An absolute must for any Star Wars fan.  Faithful to the originals.', ""The series goes down a step with this second season. The adventure evolves too slowly and always with the same mechanism: Mando goes to someone and helps him in exchange for a clue to help him lead the child back to the Jedi. It gets boring and repetitive at times. This does not detract from the fact that almost all the strengths of season 1 are confirmed from the start. Impeccable from a visual standpoint and the action scenes are insane. The introduction of characters, both old and new, makes sense for the future development of the series in the seasons to come. The bond between Mando and the baby solidifies and seeing them separated at the end breaks your heart.

I don't care that it had a western-flick vibe to it. It was just boring all the time. The show never gave me any reason to care about the protagonist. Or any reason to care about what was happening. It was never engaging or exciting. I never ever finished an episode and felt, Oh, I really have to keep watching to see what happens next. I'm baffled by why everyone likes it so much.

Then episode 3 started great with the frog people which I really liked then Bo Katan and her squad come in and... well it gets worse. It felt like they were the ""cool kids"" and they were pushed to the limit and I sort of hated Bo Katan. Also some of the lines were bad. Episode 4 was actually almost as good as 1. The child was freakin adorable with the cookies! And I just didn\'t like how season 2 was seeming to have the same formula every episode- The Mandalorian goes somewhere, meets someone, does something with them, then leaves (really?!). Well moving on to episode 5 and you got Ahsoka. That may seem cool at first but I kind of didn\'t like many of the characters in this episode including Ahsoka. And that final fight was sort of garbage. Episode 6 though was really good. Boba Fett was a straight up BAD A$$ and Fennic was cool too. It was also the only episode where I felt suspense and felt after it ended I needed another episode ASAP. Episode 7 comes along and boy it\'s almost terrible. Mayfeld (Bill Burr) was very unlikable and it felt like a stupid, laughable, and pointless episode that wasted my time. Episode 8 was a straight up disappointment. I hated how Luke just comes in and freakin copies Darth Vader\'s hallway sequence, like that is what made him menacing and stand out in Rogue One. It also felt way too rushed by cramming okay action everywhere and the tension was all over the place and it was just a sloppy mess.

The characters all either have no arcs or terrible arcs. The action is really lackluster which is disappointing because usually, the fight choreography in Star Wars movies or shows is very impressive. The acting is mediocre, not bad, just fine I guess, but Pedro Pascal has almost no material to work with because his character has the most wooden, bare-bones personality I've ever witnessed in a Star Wars character.

But as a Gen X and true fan of the Star Wars history/movies, it was a must see.\n\nThen Disney bought out LucasFilm and decided to go in a completely different direction which was going woke and destroying, insult the ""Luke Skywalker"" character. So, basically, Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy used the biggest movie franchise in history to push their woke narratives and by doing so, they totally brought down the Star Wars franchise and insulted the entire fandom in the process. The only good movie worth seeing during that period of time was ""Rogue one a Star Wars story"". \n\nThen a white Knight (Jon Favreau) came along with his ""The Mandalorian"" tv series which made the fandom say, wait a minute, let\'s see what this is all about? The first season was great and we could of seen more episodes for my taste. Then came season 2, which again kind of rallied the fandom back to Star Wars and we were curious and wanting more and boy did we sure get it! The 2nd season in itself was great but the last episode was earth shattering and Jon Favreau had his fingers on the pulse of the fandom and gave us what we wanted all along, especially after the third trilogy debacle/destruction by Rian Johnson/Kathleen Kennedy. \n\nOur hope in Star Wars was renewed and Jon Favreau had our full attention and we wanted more. So, in a nutshell, ""The Mandalorian"" totally delivered and much more. Favreau also indicated that there was other Star Wars project in the pipeline. All Star Wars fans were ecstatic and ready for more. That\'s the magic ""The Mandalorian"" brought back. \n\nBut then, even the greatness of this series and magic touch of Jon Favreau wasn\'t strong enough to protect the integrity of ""The Mandalorian"" from the evil touch of Kathleen Kennedy who fired the strongest female lead role of the show in the character of ""Cara Dune"" played by a real life kick a** true lead woman Gina Carano.  Jon Favreau had said he had big plans for the ""Cara Dune"" character but even him couldn\'t save her from the evil that is Kathleen Kennedy.

Grogu shows off more abilities but shows a darker side, especially when it comes to his appetite. Eating aliens unfertilized eggs, which is like eating potential children, I didn\'t find humorous as Jon Favrou intended. The cliffhanger wasn\'t as intense as the first seasons and I was hoping to see more out of the main villian. Boba Fett\'s return was a long time overdue! He literally ""kicked butt""!

Bold, emotional, and highlighted by character growth for the titular character, this season is not a let-down from the first season.', ""I've been a Star Wars fan since the very beginning.

SPOILER TERRITORY... It had to be Luke Skywalker (Ahsoka declined to train him as he had much fear in him & attachment towards Mando) but Luke had managed to turn Anakin towards the light, so even if Grogu had some fear in him with a master like Luke he would be fine...

Using Jedi mind trick, it planted Nostalgic fan-favorite characters throughout the season to create a false sense of awesomeness. And it worked perfectly. Season 2 was a missed opportunity. It would have been more satisfying and meaningful if only they earned it with better writing. However, I still enjoyed it. Mandalorian continues to succeed, where the sequel trilogy failed miserably.', 'An outstanding season for old and new fans. It brings in a few minor new characters, old characters from the original trilogy, and even characters from legends continuity and the prequel era of Star Wars. It has several treats for all fans, of all ages. There is a lot more action in this season which I enjoyed, as well as the infamous ""Baby Yoda."" Sure, some may say that the action doesn\'t make ""sense,"" in regards to common logic, like standing in the middle of a shoot-out, but when you focus on the amazing storytelling and depth of the show, it drowns out all of that. Once again, I am amazed by the soundtrack composed by Mr. Ludwig Göransson. Music is what makes Star Wars or, any film or series, popular and distinguishable. Göransson expressed and conveyed the right feelings with the music in certain scenes. My favorite piece from the soundtrack is ""Snacks,"" it conveys a soft, peaceful, yet sad/hopeful feeling.

Like the first season, Favreau and his cronies understand how the Star Wars aesthetic should mesh with both historical and cinematic influence, and there's plenty of nods to westerns and martial arts films here (even a little bit of cyberpunk!). Throughout the eight episodes, The Mandalorian gifts viewers with plenty of eye-widening locations, while also telling a satisfying story that does indeed connect to Star Wars lore. Fan-favorite characters from both the movies and animated series (including Ahsoka Tano, making her live-action debut) show up this season, and while it's undeniably fan-service, one should also recognize that universe-building is a favorable attribute of the franchise. This season also features some of the best action sequences you'll see all year, with plenty of enticing choreography and lots of variety, including one sequence in the premiere that (whether intentionally or not) that should prime people for the upcoming Dune movie.

I watched every single episode with my dad (who is also a HUGE Star Wars fan) and we definitely had an incredible time. The characters are very endearing and the protagonist (Mando) is such a badass.

This show seem to change its main focus altogether practically from season to season – where it started as an anthology of stories about gunslinger bounty hunter (with this whole baby Yoda merchandise cash-grab stuck onto it), it continues  as an epic about Mandalorians, Jedi, Force and all that. Putting it simply: it is much closer to what we know form the big screen, but with some obscure motives and story-lines rather than with Darth Vader and the Skywalkers (with one notable exception). And while it may please the hardcore fans of this franchise, viewers less versed in deep Star Wars lore such as myself may fell confused rather than entertained. I personally did not like this shift at all and would prefer for ""The Mandalorian"" to stick much closer to its origins. It seems, though, that I am in a minority here, and by a far margin at that.

Too much fan servicing this season to get a good score.

Also i know we often joke about the stormtroopers being incompetent shooters but seriously this is getting ridiculous.  I find no real sense of danger so no sense of high stakes to create drama in the show.

I have no words to properly praise the impressive technical attributes that transform this show into such an incredible cinematic experience. Jon Favreau and his team of talented directors all deliver remarkably well-directed episodes, but the storytelling structure needs to be calibrated to avoid some of the filler elements.

We are also introduced to Ashoka Tano played by Rosario Dawson who did an okay job with the live action sequences.

While I felt this season of The Mandalorian stumbled out of the gate, it hits its stride a few episodes in and never looks back.  Filoni and Favreau display an understanding of not only Star Wars, but its fanbase as well.  This was a critical misstep that Disney had made when they created the sequel trilogy.  Disney thought they could just take a new group of actors, intersperse them with a few of the actors from the original trilogy, shake it all up, and the fanbase will ravenously devour it because it says Star Wars on the cover--regardless of the actual story (which is equally horrid as the theme of ""Hey! What about ANOTHER Death Star--but like--a different VERSION!"" that gets beaten like the dead horse that it is.)

If it wasn\'t for the last episode I would give it a much lower score. I loved how they brought old characters back to tease their own show and I do hope they succeed. My only complain is that their presence stole the spotlight from the title character a little too much. Of course, Mando did get development in the last two episodes but I expected more. MUCH MORE. I am happy they decided to drop Grogu from the show. He had some funny moments and got a pretty cool backstory this season, which is great, however just like the old characters, he did steal the spotlight quite a bit from Din. \nClosing thoughts: I like the show. It managed to put a beating hearth back in the fandom after the disaster that the sequel trilogy was. What makes me sad is that it could be  way better. The next season will possibly focus on Mandalore and I really hope we get something deeper and more complex.

There is this thrill you'll have because they made the flow feel like an adventure with the protagonist that you can follow and admire like it's a video game with drop loads of references that shows how much the creator, writers, and directors understand the lore. All of these are what made it outstanding for a simple follower like me. And to end the whole season with a bang is so amazing. (I still can't get over it actually) I've seen a lot of reactors crying over the finale and I can see how with proper writing you can make characters, recurring or new, more valuable and their actions sensible.

EPIC, just EPIC!"", 'I want to offer some constructive feedback because I see potential in Star Wars on Disney+. So hopefully LucasFilm is reading these. Now I have never given an online review, but I felt it was called for as I want my Disney+ subscription to have good content. *Spoilers beware*\n\nI see all these reviews that are great, and as someone who has just seen the movies and these shows seem filled with insider baseball, I guess I don\'t get it? Let me compare this to The Boys, as we now have two seasons of that and Mando. I love The Boys. I think it\'s well-written, well-acted, has some good action, interesting commentary and is fun. Outside of some of the action (which is questionable since most are just shoot outs), I feel Mando is the opposite. It seems like a Saturday morning cartoon but without wanting it to be that way. I will say the acting is better this season, for sure. And the visuals are top-notch. \n\nBut when I feel more attachment to side characters in The Boys and none to Mando, the star of this show, that is problematic. Is it because he is always in the helmet? Perhaps seeing his face more would help create an emotional connection to the character. To be honest though, I think the biggest issue is lack of character development. I feel only two scenes really had impact - when he was in the forest with Ahsoka/Baby Yoda and when he took of his helmet. The acting in Pedro\'s face alone without saying a word was amazing. But 98% is shoot-out scenes. How can I appreciate the highs of a great fight scene without the ""lows"" of character development and story arcs? \n\nThe best was Episode 7, the helmet scene and Bill Burr bar scene - the tension was palpable - that is what I want! Isn\'t that the benefit of streaming shows - you have time for that where you wouldn\'t in a movie? Leave super heavy non-stop action scenes to the theaters where I can see on IMAX. Since these are only 30 minute episodes, add 20 minutes of character development. Based on other comments, I think people would appreciate longer episodes anyway - why didn\'t Mando sit with Bo-Katan and ask about what other Mando are like and question why he needs a helmet as he\'s never heard this before? Instead he said ""Peace out, gotta keep this baby moving."" And why are all these other characters popping up and taking focus off the star? Because they ALL seem cooler than Mando. Although I\'ve since learned this series is a set up for spin off series :( Isn\'t that a cinematic universe rookie mistake? Based on the finale, it seems like our Mando is done. But unfortunately I can\'t say that I\'ll miss him.\n\nHopefully they\'ll do better with their Boba Fett and Ahsoka series. And if we get a Bo-Katan series, I\'d like to see a political thriller type feel with a lot of intrigue, infighting and who-can-you-trust? \n\nThis is not the way...to bring in uninitiated fans.', ""Amazing, amazing, amazing!!! All I can say is that the second season solidifies itself as one of the best entries in Star Wars lore in a long time. I must admit the last episode completely caught me off guard.

Why do stormtroopers wear the white overalls? Certainly its not armor, because they can be knocked out with a fist. Don't they teach marksmanship at trooper school?

An odd looking young lady was sneaking up on a walled city through a dark and heavily guarded woods.  Her weapon of choice? Two noisy and very bright light sabres.  She killed several guards with them who always seemed to have their back to her in spite of all the buzzing and flaring lights and dying screams - and radio!  She never used anything else! No kicks.  No punches.  Never used her mind to whack one with a big stick or to leap twenty feet into the air Chinese martial arts style and land in the middle of a squad.  Nope.  It was always: Hide. BUZZZ!  ZAP! AAAAAAH!  Anyway, I could tell by the way she was presented that she was some big deal of a Jedi, but her backstory seemed to be left to those in the know - which I was not.  All I\'m left with is, ""Okay Miss Zippity-Zap, what up?""  We also meet a woman in the walled city, a magistrate who is mostly ""told and not showed"" as cruel.  She is lugging around a spear made of the same stuff as Mando\'s armor.  For most of the episode, she acts like the spear is really cluttering up her space and would Mando please take it away.  Turns out the spear is her weapon of choice and she\'s some grand wooly master of the spear. Her and Zippity-Zap have a show-down - all so Zippity can find out where to find someone else I\'ve never heard.  So, it is two characters I don\'t know looking for someone else I don\'t know.  This left my caring about these characters a bit on the disengaged side. I later learned this episode\'s purpose was to bring two popular animated character to live-action and their fans were just over the Forest Moon of Endor about it.  Good for them.

We're fed crumbs of dialog that have some interesting tidbits of information but, little development.  Mando finds out he's part of a cult/sect and doesn't react. No questions, no re-evaluation of his role/purpose. He apparently has an endless supply of money to vagabond around the galaxy on a quixotic quest.  With the 1/2 hour format, we're unable to develop any emotional connection to the random people Mando meets along his journey and each episode falls flat with only the hope that the next episode will give us something to latch onto.

It's Star Wars, a amazing sci fi series, that has never really been super dramatic, mainly action packed. Overall the switch to a more action oriented series is very smart.

I know what Disney is doing, and it pisses me off. They make an amazing episode like episode 9 and 11, but then have to put in these side missions. I liked episode 12, but when someone like Asoka Tano is name-dropped, and then for some reason, Mando has to get repairs for his ship but then uses his ship to get it repaired. he could have just traveled to meet Asoka and got it fixed near her, but no. Disney wants to stretch it out for 8-10 weeks so they can release a new series after. for me it\'s ""fine"" but if you want your streaming service to succeed you can\'t just have 1 original series every 2-3 months. and then when you don\'t have an original series at all, what\'s the point. I\'m sidetracking a little, but it is important to understand why there are side missions. and this TV show could easily be 100% on rotten tomatoes if they were not constrained by Disney+.

They do a good job of evoking that old feeling of Star Wars. Yes, ""Baby Yoda"" is adorable, the action scenes are solid and thrilling, the CG is impressive.  What everybody else is saying, etc.  But heading into episode 12, I have my concerns.  I really want to be excited, but suddenly....clunky dialogue, bland acting and overall lazy direction broke the spell and made this episode feel surprisingly flimsy and forgettable.  The hallway shoot-outs with storm troopers seemed tired, the threadbare plot offered little to care about, the characters had almost no genuine chemistry with each other and the attempts at humor were just flat.  The action scenes still hit pretty hard otherwise and ""Baby Yoda"" remains endearing enough.

Ugh.', '(Minor Spoilers) Like the majority of season 1, the first episode of the second season follows the same generic video-game side quest plot: unite a village to fight a monster to get some armor. This episode manages to be even more derivitive than last season, to the point that it almost feels like a self-parody. Cowboys on Tattoine who say ""howdy partner"" and ""round these parts""? While the show is gorgeous and has a few fun nostalgic nods here and there, it is a shame that the writing is so bland and fails to explore the rich universe of Star Wars. Hoping for some better episodes to follow, because I really want to like this show!', ""On par with the first season which is to say...the storyline of the week is hokey and derivative, written at a third grade level,  and loaded with cringeworthy moments.  \n\nTo be honest, all this show has going for it is Star Wars visuals and some well known guest stars.  Apparently that's enough to make it 'perfect' for some.  If you step back for a second though, it really is as mindless as it gets."", 'Holy shit mandalorian is back', ""It never get's old!!...Awesome production quality! loved it!!!"", ""Great start to season two. a little hoaky but still better than most of what's on tv today."", 'It was an amazing storyline and blast to watch the action.

Absolute blast🔥🔥', 'After only one episode this review will obviously need to be adjusted but it\'s safe to say for now it\'s a solid ""meh"". The first ep was literally filler. But I\'ll wait and see what happens over the rest of the season before making too much of a judgement.', 'A surprise to be sure but a welcome one, amazing kick off to the new season! We get to see the Krait Dragon along with a more humanized look at the Tusken Raiders. And a familiar face at the end....', 'It was a good first episode, but it fell slow to me.', 'I tried. I really did. It\'s just that I don\'t really care for the characters anymore. The action is cool and all, and it is ""Star Wars""... so that\'s fun. But that\'s it. If this was a standalone show with no relation to Star Wars, it definitely would not have the fandom it currently obtains. Also, Baby Yoda is cute but I don\'t watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 over and over again just because of baby Groot. All in all, The Mandalorian season 2 isn\'t bad, it\'s just not good either.', 'Greatest season premiere I ever seen', 'The Mandalorian brings a so much needed refreshing to the franchise and leaves you thinking about wthat the sequel movies should have actually been.', ""The premier of the Mandalorian season 2 was the accumulation of everything Jon Favreau pitched when we first heard of the show. This episode is a pure western for the first half and full-on Imax spectacle for the second half. This Episode doesn't abuse baby Yoda's popularity for more shots of him,  and this episode feels like the Mando's Episode, And continuing from last year's premiere's trend a major reveal at the end. Overall mind-blowing, feels like a movie."", 'Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.', 'A well written, action packed, heart felt, exciting, tense second series that deserves all of the love it gets.', ""So far... fantastic.

And of course Baby Yoda is as brilliant and adorable as they come!"", 'The Mandalorian, once again, showing the world that Star Wars is much more than Jedi, Sith and lightsaber combats. What a great season is upon us!', 'A fantastic 2nd season. We met some great new characters and got more of old characters we love. Every episode is different and very enjoyable. The music is fantastic and just like the 1st season it gets you into the Mandalorian mood.', 'Plodded along. Overproduced and lacks spirit.', 'La serie es demasiado buena y te deja atento al siguiente episodio', ""Exceptional, the whole story, the witty, the black sense of humor, the action, the recall from places, ships and characters from prequels and OT, the reveal at the end... Ufff so much to see and digest, a total eye candy, a real gift to Star Wars fans and for the ones that aren't."", ""Its so good so far! Really love the styles, love how the show flows, its really well made and can't wait to see more!!"", 'There are no words to sum up how good this season is, everything about it is great.', 'Boring, and too many filler episides.', ""The first episode was great fun , Cobb Vanth was a interesting weston style character. The ties to the aftermath novels were a real surprise. Seeing a scene basically recreated from the books makes reading them feel like an actual payoff. The way the show can unite the fans by tying in the prequal, originals, sequels and legends can't be overstated. Can't wait for next week"", 'The first episode of season two was another enjoyable chapter of the Mandalorian. It does suffer from a lack of narrative ambition at times and I would like to see greater risks taken by the writers in the upcoming episodes, but a hefty amount of fan service and typically stunning visuals have made me excited for the rest. I only hope that it can branch out from the first season and really put a stamp on the Star Wars universe.', 'Love the feel of season 2 so far, ep 3 was God-tier. Amazing storytelling and 10/10 action.', 'Great season premiere and great nod to the Aftermath novels, with the addition of Cobb Vanth and how he acquired to Boba Fett armor. Epic, cinematic, and also a lot of fun.', 'What a great start for season 2, Really amazing.', ""Minor Spoilers: Episode 1 of Season 2 wasn't bad, it wasn't great, but it was good. Most of the plot seems to be lifted from eps 1,2, and 4 of season 1. So if you've seen those you already know what's going to happen and pretty much the conclusion. It didn't tie into a larger narrative for the season and was just a stand alone action piece. Don't expect much baby yoda (the child) he more or less is there, and they remind the audience from time to time by cutting to him to let everyone know he is still in the show. Cobb Vance was interesting but with a reused plot for the episode (eps 2,4 of season 1), they didn't do as much with his character as I would have liked. There is a big reveal at the last moment of the episode that I wish they would have gotten to sooner since we ALL knew it was coming. All in all it's an okay start, like the first season, but not as good as it could have been. What keeps me watching is only because I'm a huge Star Wars fan, if I wasn't then it would have lost my interest."", 'Amazing, just as good as the first season!', 'Its just like the first season but bigger and better', 'its just as good as the first season (which was great)', 'After the first episode all I can say is: wow, just wow.

Design of the Dragon was disappointing.  After both Tremors and the worms from Dune this needed to be a realistic, completely different type of animal.  Just wasn't imaginative enough."", 'The Mandalorian Season 2: Episode 1 was a fresh return to the action that we had come to love in Season 1. Much of the action that was packed into this episode helps the Mandalorians story continue to develop and help him on his quest.', 'Great season, better than season 1 IMO. Good story progression and world building. Wonderfully crafted with care. PogU', 'Wow! Just wow! Talk about a strong opening. With the introduction of Timothy Olyphant and with an action packed plot The Marshal sets a very high standard for the second season of The Mandalorian.\nThis might be the best episode, this show has offered thus far.', 'Such a brilliant opening episode for season 2!!

Yes its cheesy, goofy, silly, and light hearted and even stupid. Its called entertainment. Its not suppose to be serious. Its heart warming and loving and interesting and has a little action.  Like all shows that exist there are a few things in the series that are off putting. But overall the show is excellent and well worth watching. I love it and have watched every show 3-4 times. I cant believe that when a light hearted show comes people want more of the junk that is out there. I'm tired of hateful shows where people are not supportive of each other or shows about murder.

The interplay between the characters gets more interesting with every episode. I especially like the interaction between Josh Peck's uptight, fastidious US marshal vs. Brandon Jay McLaren's inscrutable, spaced out version, which gets funnier over time. Vanessa Lengies is delightful as the dog trainer with eyes for Josh's oblivious character.\n\nI like that the writers are taking their time with Hooch getting training, as it creates plenty of opportunity for things to seemingly go off the rails, and lets the character development happen gradually, which I appreciate. \n\nThe show has good stunts for a TV show, and at times has intense though bloodless violence that may catch some parents off-guard for very young viewers. A few lines uttered during or immediately after fight scenes were surprising and brilliantly funny. \n\nMatt Nix has created a nice show here, and is letting the characters evolve pleasingly over time."", 'I loved the acting and the story, but the biggest win for me was that my 13 year old made Wednesday\'s a ""must-see-family-TV"" date, which is an added and rare gift.  It\'s kind of rare to find a show that my wife and I, and our 13 and 16 year old all love.   The only complaint I had is thinking about all the paper towels and 409 I\'d have to buy cleaning up after Hooch.  He\'s a lovable TERROR!', ""Surprisingly has solid action scenes that are not meant for young children under a certain age. The script is very well written and keeps you engaged and laughing or smiling. I love that the plot points are about crimes. \n\nThe characters are the best part of the show because they're so likeable and relatable. The engaging performances of the actors and actresses are what really help to seal the deal. I have to give a shout out to some excellent directing choices that elevate suspenseful moments.\n\nI also love that there is dog knowledge shared throughout the show, especially when it relates to police work. It was a great idea to have each episode have its own crime to solve, but that the show is setting up an overarching mystery that keeps you on your toes.

The cast is great and the dog is adorable."", ""Turner & Hooch is a new version of the classic from the 80s perp in its first episode it is very poorly executed we have a more childish look than the original film, we have characters that still do not connect with us the audience, the protagonists still do not develop very clearly but hey we're still going through the first episode so the story can develop"", ""I'm going to be honest. The show isn't that bad. I go as far as to say it's a pretty good start. But that's my opinion. I enjoy Josh Peck as Scott Jr. and his dynamic with Hooch. I can't wait for more.."", 'WOW. I hope ep2 is better. Gal is pregnant and working US MARSHALS???  Forget the baby! Also no seatbelt for her in car.
